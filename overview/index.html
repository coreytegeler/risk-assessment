How do we know what else we should be concerned about? How can we develop our own privacy practices as well as give advice to our library users?</p><p>Risks vary from person to person. For example, a Visa card data breach impacts anyone who uses these cards, but a person who does not have a credit card will not need to worry about this. Patrons that use social media need to consider their privacy settings on those sites, as well as the terms of service of those companies. Journalists may need to protect who they contact, in addition to the content of their conversations.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><strong>When thinking about patrons, we assess risks based on a few elements:</strong><div class="panel-group" id="accordion" role="tablist" aria-multiselectable="true"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading" id="headingOne" role="tab"><h4 class="panel-title"><a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne">Who you are.</a></h4></div><div class="panel-collapse collapse in" id="collapseOne" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingOne"><div class="panel-body">The patron population is diverse and faces different kinds of threats depending on who they are.

Some patrons might worry about a parent finding out about certain kinds of information, while others might be concerned about a snooping employer or marketing companies. Whether that person or entity is likely to be successful at accessing that information is another important consideration. Patrons might be concerned about their employer, but the likelihood that the company is actually surveilling its employees could be very low.</div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading" id="headingFour" role="tab"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree">What are you already doing to protect yourself?</a></h4></div><div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseFour" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFour"><div class="panel-body">Some patrons might already be taking steps to protect their privacy. Knowing this is an important step along the way to making recommendations for what more they can do to protect the information they care about from risky people or entities. In general, we want to make recommendations that are most appropriate and considerate of patron’s needs.</div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading" id="headingFive" role="tab"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseFive" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFive">What are the consequences, and how impactful would the consequences be for you?</a></h4></div><div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseFive" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFive"><div class="panel-body">When assessing risk, you should be ready to identify and evaluate the relative impact of someone accessing your information without your consent. For example, you might be a victim of identity theft after someone steals your email passwords and other essential account log-in credentials. Identity theft would be highly impactful to your economic and emotional well-being. You may have to spend years rebuilding your credit, which was damaged when the identity thief borrowed or spent your money in your name. In another example, a former partner may try to harass you by finding out your whereabouts via your social media posts, which can have emotional or personal safety consequences for you. By comparison, the consequences of someone finding out your PIN for your library card may be less damaging. The differences in these situations have implications for what you should do to protect yourself, such as using a password manager and a VPN and untagging yourself from Facebook photos, versus using a more complex password for your library PIN. In short, context matters. People will need privacy "armor" that's appropriate for particular situations.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="meet section"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-10 col-centered"><h2 class="text-center">Let's meet our patrons.</h2></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12 col-centered"><div class="col-sm-3"><img src="../imgs/luca.svg"><p> <strong>Luca</strong>, a single parent with limited digital literacy skills and limited English skills, relies on the library for access to computers and the Internet.</p></div><div class="col-sm-3"><img src="../imgs/jo.svg"><p> <strong>Jo</strong>, an artist who regularly comes to the library to do research about strange and sensitive subject matter on both library computers and her own laptop.</p></div><div class="col-sm-3"><img src="../imgs/sara.svg"><p> <strong>Sara </strong>is leaving a difficult family situation and uses the library computers and wifi to access social media, look for housing, and read the news.</p></div><div class="col-sm-3"><img src="../imgs/xav.svg"><p><strong>Xav</strong>, an outspoken, politically minded twenty-something, uses the library computers to search for jobs</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="luca patron section"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-4"><img src="../imgs/luca.svg"><h4 class="text-center">Patron 1: Luca</h4></div><div class="col-sm-8"><div class="col-sm-12 bhoechie-tab-container"><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-4 bhoechie-tab-menu"><div class="list-group"><a class="list-group-item active text-center" href="#"><h4>About</h4></a><a class="list-group-item text-center" href="#"><h4>Risks</h4></a><a class="list-group-item text-center" href="#"><h4>Step 1</h4></a><a class="list-group-item text-center" href="#"><h4>Step 2</h4></a><a class="list-group-item text-center" href="#"><h4>Step 3</h4></a><a class="list-group-item text-center" href="#"><h4>Step 4</h4></a><a class="list-group-item text-center" href="#"><h4>Summary</h4></a></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-8 bhoechie-tab"><div class="bhoechie-tab-content active"><p>Luca, a single parent with limited digital literacy skills and limited English skills, relies on the library for access to computers and the Internet.

You can also test password strength--not your real passwords, but similar kinds of passwords--on password testing sites like this one.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><strong>Use sites that are secure (e.g., use HTTPS) for personal transactions.</strong> Websites that are encrypted prevent anyone else but you--the sender making the request to visit a particular website--and the website itself from seeing the data traveling between your computer and the website. Many people come to the library because it is the only place they are able to conduct all sorts of very personal business, such as applying to a job, renewing unemployment insurance, and banking online. Any time you have to submit data you care about and don’t want anyone else but the recipient to see, make sure you see the HTTPS or padlock icon in the browser’s address bar.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><strong>Log out of a library terminal before walking away.</strong> When you are still logged into a terminal and walk away from your session, the person who sits down at the computer next may be able to see your web history, any sites that you are still logged into, and any documents you may have stored in the computer’s temporary drive.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="footer"></div></body></html>
