If you are using HTTP, library network operators can see the information you send and receive; if you are using HTTPS, network operators can only see which sites you visit and not the content. Library policies will vary from institution to institution. Check with your library to see how long it retains this data.</p></div></div></div><div class="slide" data-anchor="slide2"><div class="col-sm-8 col-centered specialbox"><h3>Who is most likely to steal your password and access your accounts?</h3><p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2">Parents</a><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2">Spouse</a><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2">Sibling</a><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2">Classmate</a><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2">Thief</a><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2">Another patron</a></p><div class="collapse" id="collapse2"><p>Any of these people may try to obtain or guess your password without your consent. A strong password should be hard to guess by someone who knows you (so, it shouldn’t include easily known information like your name or address or pet’s name).nd, it should be hard to guess by computer programs that digital thieves might use (password should be as long as possible and include an assortment of capital letters, symbols and numbers).</p></div></div></div><div class="slide" data-anchor="slide3"><div class="col-sm-8 col-centered specialbox"><h3>True or false: During a web browsing session in private or incognito mode, cookies cannot communicate information about your browsing behavior to third parties.</h3><p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse3">True</a><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse3">False</a></p><div class="collapse" id="collapse3"><p><strong>False.</strong> Although your dad or wife might not be able to see what sites you’ve visited on you computer, your Internet provider, websites you’re visiting, and third parties embedded in those sites can see who you are. The requests your computer or computer device makes to a website will include your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address. Cookies on websites include cookies used by the website itself and third party cookies like those used by ad networks. These cookies are invisible to the common user even though they will also communicate with your computer and know you by your IP address. Because they know your IP address, they can track your behavior across any site where they can send cookies. The only way to hide your IP address from the third parties and websites is by using a virtual private network (VPN), which will cloak any requests, or by using the Tor browser. Note that when using a VPN, that company or VPN provider will know what sites you are visiting. All in all, private browsing simply hides your usage history from other users on your computer.</p></div></div></div><div class="slide" data-anchor="slide4"><div class="col-sm-8 col-centered specialbox"><h3>True or false: Using a public library’s open wi-fi means your online behavior is anonymous.</h3><p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse4">True</a><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse4">False</a></p><div class="collapse" id="collapse4"><p><strong>False.</strong> Websites that can see your computer’s IP address, websites that you log on to with a username and password, and apps that you have turned on your phone will be able to identify you. Additionally, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) that supplies connectivity to the library will be able to identify the IP address affiliated with unsecured HTTP requests made by a library computer terminal or your computer device on the library network. ISPs will have their own data retention policies. Library network operators will be able to identify who logs on to the library network using the computer reservation system, though check with your library’s computer usage policies to find out how long your library retains that information.</p></div></div></div><div class="slide" data-anchor="slide5"><div class="col-sm-8 col-centered specialbox"><h3>True or false: When a website has a privacy policy, it means the site will not share my information with other websites and companies without my permission.</h3><p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse5">True</a><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse5">False</a></p><div class="collapse" id="collapse5"><p><strong>False.</strong> A privacy policy is a company’s way of communicating to the consumer what kinds of data it collects and the categories or types of third parties with whom the company shares data. A privacy policy will also provide information about its online tracking practices, such as the use of cookies. In other words, if you use a site or app, you’re not setting your privacy terms, you’re agreeing to play by that company’s rules.</p></div></div></div><div class="slide" data-anchor="slide6"><div class="col-sm-8 col-centered specialbox"><h3>True or false: Most websites are encrypted.</h3><p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse6">True</a><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse6">False</a></p><div class="collapse" id="collapse6"><p><strong>False.</strong> A website is encrypted when it has HTTPS in the address bar. Using HTTPS, the content of the website request is encrypted from the server to you. This means that when checking your email using HTTPS, the content of the email invisible only to the email server and to you. However, even when using HTTPS, the webpage’s IP address itself is not encrypted, and so what website you are visiting could be discovered (for example, https://www.signsiampregnant.info). The percentage of HTTPS traffic relative to all web traffic is less than 50 percent, though the precise amount varies from report to report, and the trend is generally increasing. Most email providers, banks, and checkout pages on shopping websites use HTTPS.</p></div></div></div><div class="slide" data-anchor="slide7"><div class="col-sm-8 col-centered specialbox"><h3>True or false: It is safe to use the same password for multiple user accounts, as long as it contains a few different letters, numbers, or symbols.</h3><p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse7">True</a><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse7">False</a></p><div class="collapse" id="collapse7"><p><strong>False.</strong> Using the same password across websites is generally not a good idea, because if one service is compromised or discovered, then all of your accounts are in jeopardy. Instead, if you use a unique password for each account, you minimize the damage if one site is hacked or leaks information.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="hygiene section"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-centered"><h1>What is digital hygiene?</h1></div><div class="col-sm-9 col-centered"><p>When we talk about being safe and secure online and protecting data you care about, we’re referring to digital hygiene.

You can use a password manager to both generate and store hard-to-remember passwords for you. You can also test password strength--not your real passwords, but similar kinds of passwords--on password testing sites like this one.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><img class="text-center" src="imgs/secure.svg"><p><strong>Use sites that are secure (e.g., use HTTPS) for personal transactions.</strong> Websites that are encrypted prevent anyone else but you--the sender making the request to visit a particular website--and the website itself from seeing the data traveling between your computer and the website. Many people come to the library because it is the only place they are able to conduct all sorts of very personal business, such as applying to a job, renewing unemployment insurance, and banking online. Any time you have to submit data you care about and don’t want anyone else but the recipient to see, make sure you see the HTTPS or padlock icon in the browser’s address bar.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><img class="text-center" src="imgs/logout.svg"><p><strong>Log out of a library terminal before walking away.</strong> When you are still logged into a terminal and walk away from your session, the person who sits down at the computer next may be able to see your web history, any sites that you are still logged into, and any documents you may have stored in the computer’s temporary drive.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="transmitting section"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"><h1>When transmitting data online, what’s a good way to assess risk?</h1></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9 col-centered"><p>As mentioned above, there are some digital privacy basic hygiene practices we recommend.
